    <h3>Capture Ideas</h3>
    <p>
      When the creative juices are flowing, the last thing you need is a program
      that you have to think about. BrainStorm lets you just tap away. Put your
      thoughts in as they occur to you. Don't worry about sequence or structure,
      that can come later. You can pursue the highways and byways of your mind,
      if one thought gives rise to a bunch of related thoughts they can all be
      'hung off' the first thought at the time or later, when it suits you. The
      important thing is that you capture your thoughts without having to worry
      about how to 'work' BrainStorm. At its simplest, you just type.
      Hierarchies of ideas can be created by clicking away with the mouse or
      using the Home and End keys. Preparing a presentation Think of a
      BrainStorm model as a list. Any entry in the list can have its own list
      attached. And identical entries in separate lists are automatically
      hyperlinked. Imagine you have captured someone's contact details. Every
      time you type that person's name as a BrainStorm entry, all the previously
      stored details presented to you instantly. While this is massively useful
      and it is one of the ways in which BrainStorm stands apart from other
      programs, such a connection can be suppressed with a single mouse click.

    <h3>Capture Information</h3>
    <p>
      BrainStorm will try to make sense of any file it is offered. A text file
      will be easy. A formatted file from a word processor, for example, might
      not look so pretty, but it will try. By far the easiest way to transfer
      information into BrainStorm is to copy it directly from the screen.
      Whether you're in a word processor, a database, an Acrobat document or a
      web page, simply highlight the material you want and copy it. If you have
      a scanner and recognition software, you can capture information from paper
      sources as well. The fastest way to capture on-screen information is with
      BrainStorm's 'Magic paste'. As soon as you copy anything to the clipboard
      (using Ctrl+c or the copy command), it is immediately picked up by
      BrainStorm. You don't have to do anything else. Alternatively you can use
      regular paste or Smart paste, both of which require you to bring
      BrainStorm to the foreground before pasting. Each kind of paste offers you
      a variety of formatting options for the incoming material. You can ignore
      leading spaces or use them to indicate hierarchy. You can let BrainStorm
      figure out where paragraphs start and end, or insist that the information
      is imported exactly as it appears on screen. With Magic paste, you can
      define a separator, which might include date and time, to precede each
      paste so you can clearly distinguish between each paste. The separator and
      date/time paste functions are also available at the click of an icon.

    <h3>Organize Quickly</h3>
    <p>
      You can reorder your information in the traditional way by selecting and
      dragging/dropping or by cutting and pasting. But, since reorganization is
      at the heart of BrainStorm's functionality, you won't be surprised to
      learn that it has some additional useful ways of moving information
      around. You can open a second window on the current model and navigate
      around each window independently, making it easy to drag and drop entries
      from one part of a model to another. This is great when you have got
      chapter headings, for example, and you want to move all related entries to
      the level below their chapter headings. (Just hold 'shift' while dragging
      and dropping.) An alternative would be to Throw entries directly by
      pressing Ctrl+t. Just whiz down your dumped thoughts and information and,
      every time, you see an entry that relates to the topic of interest, Throw
      it. This is fast. Much faster than drag and drop. A related command throws
      a copy of the selected entries, so the same information is on tap at
      multiple locations. This barely increases the model file size because the
      lower level detail is stored only once 'Push down' and 'Push up' commands
      allow you to grab blocks of entries and either make them subsidiary to an
      existing entry or push them up a level by dropping them onto the heading
      icon. You can even resequence material on the fly by selecting it in the
      desired sequence prior to a drag or a throw. It will arrive in the
      selected sequence. Or you can use the more conventional sort commands to
      arrange selected entries into ascending or descending alphabetical
      sequence.

    <h3>Add &amp; Enhance</h3>
    <p>
      As you build your BrainStorm information model, it will probably stimulate
      further thoughts. Just drop them in. You could do this in a different
      color, so you can see the evolution of your work. You can paste in date
      and/or time details if you wish but, when preparing documentation, this
      might hinder rather than help. BrainStorm is geared to the free flow of
      ideas. The various paste options mean that you can capture additional
      material from the computer screen as you find it. Magic paste, in
      particular is excellent for this. Just highlight what you like the look
      of, press ctrl+c and it is automatically copied into BrainStorm. If you
      are worried about corrupting the work you have already done, why not
      protect existing work from alteration by making it 'read only'. This can
      be done very easily for part or all of your work. If you go into Aerial
      view, you will see how your work is evolving. Presentation - aerial view
      This lists each entry on a single line and indents successive levels.
      Thus, by looking at the left hand edge of the list, you can see where in
      the model you have plenty of information and where it's a bit light. You
      can instantly shift your focus to a weaker area of your model by double
      clicking at the appropriate point.

  <div class="feature">
    <h3>Publish &amp; Share</h3>
    <p>
      If your colleagues and friends use BrainStorm, that is the easiest way to
      share your thoughts and information with each other. However, you can also
      publish two kinds of HTML document as well as writing to text files and to
      the clipboard. You can write the model as a text file, as an outline if
      you wish. And you can use spaces or tabs to determine successive levels.By
      outputting as plain text, you lose the internal hyperlinks between
      identical entries, but then if your friend or colleague is reading the
      file with a text or word processor, or even an outliner, then this won't
      matter too much. We provide a template for Word which presents the
      BrainStorm model very nicely in both Normal and Outline views You can also
      publish your model as a simple HTML page, which makes it readable by a
      host of other programs, including Word. More interestingly, perhaps, is
      that you can output your model as an HTML page, complete with an embedded
      JavaScript 'mind-reader' which attempts to present your information as a
      hierarchical, navigable model, complete with the original hyperlinks.
      Here's a sample clipping: HTML 'mind-reader' In modern browsers your
      information appears pretty much as it does in BrainStorm. The entry icons
      are clickable and the hypertext links (we call them 'namesakes') are
      easily followed. You can search the model and, in general, navigate it the
      way you do in BrainStorm itself. Of course, being a browser view means
      that it cannot be edited. The older the browser, the less snappy the
      display. The very oldest browsers will give up on the clever stuff and
      just display the model as an outline, using HTML's heading styles to
      differentiate between levels. BrainStorm's merge command allows you to
      embed BrainStorm and other files within the existing model. This can be
      useful when collecting contributions from other people. Assuming they are
      BrainStorm users, you just send them out a template of the information you
      require and ask them to throw in their suggestions, perhaps each using a
      different color. When you get these models in, you can merge them such
      that all their contributions appear under the respective headings but in
      their own colors. Finally, we can provide a Java browser which you can
      embed in your own web page. You can point this to any BrainStorm model on
      your web server and it will be even snappier than the web-published
      version..

    <h3>Instant Recall</h3>
    <p>
      All the information in your BrainStorm models is instantly on tap, and in
      the context you last left it. Some people return to models after years and
      'think their way' back in to their work. The Find and Find again commands
      are probably the most obvious way of finding information that you know is
      in the model somewhere. An alternative would be to exploit the 'namesake'
      feature of the program. If you know what you are after, just type enough
      of the entry to be unique and bracket it with asterisks and the entry will
      be replicated at your fingertips. For example, *just type enough* would
      find the above paragraph. Immediately, any deeper level information about
      that entry is at your fingertips. All the information about the character
      in the play, for example, is there on tap. A 'namesake' icon will appear
      to the left of your new entry to show that this is one in a chain of
      identical entries. Just press the left or right arrow key to go to the
      previous or next occurrence of the entry. You will see each in its
      original context. Whether searching or namesaking or just browsing around
      your model, you will find that BrainStorm makes finding information a
      breeze.

    <h3>Check Progress</h3>
    <p>
      Progress monitoring comes in two forms. One is the progress of your
      information-gathering work. The other is the progress of the project on
      which you're engaged. BrainStorm helps with both. The aerial view is
      probably the best way of reviewing your progress with building your
      freeform information database (which is what BrainStorm is). This shows
      your model in outline form and you can navigate up and down, and from side
      to side, to see how the work is progressing. You might also assign part of
      your model, or a separate one, to your deadlines and deliverables. It's a
      simple matter to keep this updated and monitor progress in a more
      conventional way. You can even send out copies of your model for others to
      make their own contributions. These can all be merged together to create a
      'supermodel' of all your ideas and inputs. If you get colleagues to put
      their name against each contribution or work in a particular color, it is
      easy to keep on top of things. When Marck and David were developing
      BrainStorm, they met up very occasionally - once or twice a year, yet the
      project was entirely managed using BrainStorm (there was a DOS version
      before the Windows version). They used to pass a single file back and
      forth, each updating when they had possession. Then they incorporated the
      Merge function, which meant that single file passing was no longer
      necessary.
