    <p>My reply (to the links, not to the reader, whose opinions it doesn&#8217;t represent):</p>\
    <p>I understand that the topic of cognition is quite complex, and I am not making any claims about structuring lists,\
    writing longtext documents or designing layouts.</p><p>I am saying that simultaneous comprehension of the interconnections\
    between all child entries of an outline&#8217;s parent entry is limited to about 7 brief items, or less.</p>\
    <p>This is a general rule; obviously there are places where you would make exceptions.</p>\
    <p>The main fallacy of the misapplications dissected in the articles linked to is that <strong>most situations do not\
    require simultaneous apprehension</strong>. It is perfectly acceptable to scan through a document serially, rather than\
    attempting to comprehend its entirety at once. However, when rapidly structuring an outline, we need to immediately\
    comprehend the entirety of the &#8220;small picture&#8221; at each layer, so that the &#8220;big picture&#8221; can\
    automatically build itself with minimal mental exertion.</p> \
    <p>I find that 7 is the practical limit for this, and often I prefer 6 or 5.</p>\
    <p>The rule of 7 does refer to an experimentally verified limit of human mental capacity; it is just that\
    <strong>cognition in practical situations has many ways of getting around this limitation</strong>, so trying to apply a\
    rule of 7 naively as a general rule for designing everything is quite stupid.</p> \
    <p>I am not just talking about short term memory, the capacity to store and recall, but also the capacity to comprehend as an\
    interconnected whole. The visuo-spatial analogue would be thinking of how seven moving parts interact in an engineering design.</p> \
    <p>Furthermore, the last link claims the number is even lower, 3 or 4. Perhaps this is true, but that is irrelevant since\
    we do not have to remember by brute force when constructing an outline in BrainStorm; the text is remembered for us on the\
    screen. We need only comprehend the interrelationships, i.e. ensure our categories are properly divided.</p> \
    <p>I think 3 or 4 is too simplistic for most people; 5 or 6 is where I&#8217;m most comfortable.</p><p>~JB</p>',

      <p>&#8220;Next is a truly obscure underdog: software called BrainStorm, created and sold by two independent programmers\
      in England. Its kind of elegance, quite distinct from the style and polish of the Mac or TiVo, is the stripped-down functional\
      beauty of an excellent sharpened knife.</p><p>BrainStorm is a return to the early days of personal computing, in its\

		story:
			'<p>&#8230;and making us wonder, if BrainStorm were available in the 70&#8217;s, would he have written <a title="The Hitchhiker\'s\
      Guide to the Galaxy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker\'s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"><em><strong>The Hitchhiker&#8217;s\
      Guide to the Galaxy</strong></em></a> in BrainStorm?</p><p>Early 1980s</p>Douglas Adams writer, dramatist, musician\
      and author of <em><a title="The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker\'s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">\
      <strong>The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy</strong></a></em>, faxed this letter to David Tebbutt, BrainStorm creator and\
      founder. </span></p><p>&#8220;Here, as promised, is BrainStorm properly configured to use the Rainbow line-drawing graphics.\
      If you SUBMIT BRAIN you will load the function key processor which works with it. You will probably find the key assignments\
      I’ve made seem strange to you. I’m still experimenting, and trying to make the controls correspond as closely as I can to my\
      word processing function keys. Changing key assignments is very easy and self explanatory. Simply type FK from the system prompt\
      to get into the function key programme and make changes. Each key will take up to 128 characters. Come to think of it, the programme’s\
      documentation on disk so I’ll add that on.</p><p>I’ve also included some information from the Rainbow technical manual\
      and from a recent article which enable you to speed up the VDU display. It’s pretty slow at the moment.</p> \
      <p>I’m beginning to boggle at the scope of your programme. It’s quite extraordinary – and addictive.</p> \
      <p>One or two questions.</p><p>What’s BRUN.COM for? It gets mentioned in passing in the manual but never explained.</p>\
      <p>Is there any way of deleting all occurrences of a namesake? I’m sure there must be and I just haven’t found it yet.</p>\
      <p>Loading and saving are rather tedious chores at the moment. Three useful facilities to incorporate would be:</p>\
      <p>1)The ability to reset the default drive during INSALLB.</p>\
      <p>2)The ability to invoke the appropriate .BRN file at the same time you load the programme. For example: &gt;brain diary.brn</p>\
      <p>3)A quick save capability. So that everytime<span> </span>you go and get a cup of coffee you can hit a couple of keys and update\
      your disk whilst you’re away. That way, REBRAIN becomes less necessary – prevention is better than cure.</p>\
      <p>Will the 16-bit version allow you to use all your computer’s available memory? And run other programmes outside BRAINSTORM?\
      That way you would have just one huge personal database which you would simply stay in all day whatever work you were doing.\
      The possibilities are endless.</p><p>Anyway, congratulations on a brilliant idea. Hope it makes you a rich man.</p>\
      <p>Best wishes,</p><p>Douglas Adams&#8221;</p>\
      <P>The following two images are of a fax sent by Douglas Adams to BrainStorm Software in the early eighties.<P> \
      Some of his hand-written stuff has faded. The tick and the margin note are mine. And it looks as if his fax creased the paper as he was \
      sending it.<P>Wish I\'d scanned it when it was still legible.<P> To answer his last comment: nope, it hasn\'t made me a rich man. Not in\
      money terms anyway. It\'s been a lot of fun and hard work and we enjoy a good relationship with our users. <P>&nbsp;<p>\

		title: "Someone with writing issues",

		intro:
			"<p>Recently, I was talking with someone who has trouble with writing. She&#8217;s great at talking and is very articulate. Somehow, when it comes to writing, she has issues. The words never come out as well as she speaks and the logical flow gets lost.</p>",
		story:
			'<p>I&#8217;ve just dropped her a note, the main content of which follows. It starts by talking about a mutual contact:</p> <blockquote>\
      <p>&#8230; I think he&#8217;s rather keener on MindJet&#8217;s MindManager now. But, at the time,  he got a lot of value out of BrainStorm.</p>\
      <p>The two programs are not synonymous. BrainStorm grabs your thoughts and text clippings from anywhere quickly and easily and lets you bugger about with them &#8211;\
      moving, structuring, editing and so on.</p>\
      <p>As I mentioned the other day in London, I use it a lot. (Background, I wrote it originally to help me with managing, editing and writing &#8211; in 1981.)</p>\
      <p>It occurs to me that you might find it useful, especially for grabbing the key points, establishing a sequence, identifying and filling gaps, and outputting a template\
      for whatever it is you&#8217;re trying to write.</p>\
      <p>It sits in a space apart from outliners (although it resonates with them) and mind mappers (although it resonates with them too). It was written before both appeared on\
      the market. It is text. It is simple. It is fast. It doesn&#8217;t get in the way of your thinking.</p>\
      <p>I can&#8217;t  remember which is best to start with, but &#8216;real life organisation&#8217; would appear  to hold promise.</p>\
      <p>The  website, as you&#8217;ve probably realised, is <a href="/">www.brainstormsw.com</a> and the program is free to download and use for 30 days. I can\
      extend that if you need more time to evaluate it. The download is only a couple of meg and installation takes about a minute.</p>\
      <p>I&#8217;m not going to claim it&#8217;s intuitive &#8211; although some people fall for it straight away. It&#8217;s something to do with how we&#8217;re wired, I think.</p> \
      <p>In essence it&#8217;s a list. Any entry in the list can have its own list &#8216;underneath&#8217; &#8211; double click on an entry&#8217;s icon or press &#8216;Home&#8217;\
      and it becomes a heading, ready for its own list. The same entry can appear in multiple places and they&#8217;re automatically hyperlinked. This has powerful uses which I\
      won&#8217;t bore you with here.</p> <p>The whole can be displayed as an outline for when you&#8217;re figuring out how far you&#8217;ve got or whether there are gaps or too\
      much information.</p><p>And it can be printed, written to a file, published as HTML or OPML and so on. Frankly, the publishing aspects are not central. The &#8216;Write\
      to clipboard&#8217; is probably the most useful output because you can then drop the text (or the outline) into another program.</p>\
      </blockquote><p>I thought that if this description helps my friend, it might help you.</p><p>PS I have just installed and created a small project in MindManager Pro 7.\
      It&#8217;s a totally different animal and I really shouldn&#8217;t have mentioned it in the same breath as BrainStorm. It is a comprehensive graphical mind-mapping\
      program with all manner of presentational features and project management tools. BrainStorm is much more of a personal tool: a mind assistant primarily for your own benefit.\
      Think Segway versus jumbo jet.</p>',

      <p><strong>From me:</strong></p><blockquote><p>On the  &quot;all strings&quot; &#8211; I usually  &quot;Write&quot;  &quot;Only entries containing this text&quot;\
      to the clipboard then paste. The pasted lines form namesakes with the originals (of course). You may want to write just one level.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>Let us know if\
      this helps.</p></blockquote><p><strong>From Jack:</strong></p><blockquote><p>Thanks David.  That works great. What an incredible and powerful feature for setting\
